        description: "Homo Sapiens first appeared in Iberia around 35,000 B.C.E. It appears as if these peoples did develop cultures and thus languages, however they had a negligable if any influence on the Spanish language. The Phonecians also appeared to have colonize parts of what is now Spain, however their language also played a minimal or no role in the development of Spanish. The Greeks also explored into Iberia, however the Greek influence on Spanish was proxied by Latin, which is derived partially from Greek. Native Iberians did appear to adopt aspects of their conquerors cultures, traditions, and literature. A writing system based on that of the Phonecians developed in the southwest while Greek-based ones developed in the southeast and in Catalonia, these scripts faded out of use when the Romans arrived and all of them remain untranslated to this day.",
